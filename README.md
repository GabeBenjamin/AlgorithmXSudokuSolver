# Algorithm X Sudoku Solver

This is a project to implement [Donald Knuth's Algorithm X](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047 "Algorithm X") using his [DancingLinks data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) structure, which is a solution to the NP-Complete Exact Cover Problem. We then use this aglorithm to solve an n x n sudoku board. There are two main parts to this project: the Sudoku Verifier and the Sudoku Solver. Solving a sudoku board is a form of the exact cover problem and thereofre is also NP-Complete. THis means that we can write a polynomial time verifier, but not a solver.

## Sudoku Verifier
//TODO

## Sudoku Solver
We use Knuth's Algorithm X and DancingLinks to create a Sudoku Solver relatively efficiently.
